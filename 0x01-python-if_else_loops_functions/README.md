Overview: This project cover Python Functions, Loops, and Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)


0-positive_or_negative.py - this program determines if a random integer is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result
1-last_digit.py - this program determines if the last digit of a random integer is greater than, zero, or less than 6 but is not zero and prints the result
2-print_alphabet.py - this program prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
3-print_alphabt.py - this program prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line, except e and q
4-print_hexa.py - this program prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (e.g. 96 = 0x60)
5-print_comb2.py - this program prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by a comma and space
6-print_comb3.py - this program prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by a comma and space
7-islower.py - this function checks for lowercase character
8-uppercase.py - this function prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line
9-print_last_digit.py - this function prints the last digit of a number
10-add.py - this function adds two integers and returns the result
11-pow.py - this function computes a to the power of b and return the value
12-fizzbuzz.py - this function prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space, replacing multiple of 3 with Fizz, multiples of 5 with Buzz, and multiples of both with FizzBuzz
13-insert_number.c - this C function inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list, and returns the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
